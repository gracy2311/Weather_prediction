This Weather Prediction Webpage is a dynamic web application that displays real-time weather information for any city. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integrated with a public weather API (like OpenWeatherMap), users can search for a location and instantly view details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The interface is responsive and user-friendly, making it accessible across devices. JavaScript fetches live data and updates the page dynamically without reloading. This project is ideal for learning how to work with APIs, handle asynchronous requests, and build interactive, real-world applications using basic web development tools.
